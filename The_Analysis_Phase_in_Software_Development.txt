1. Definition and Importance of the Analysis Phase

The Analysis Phase is the second stage of the SDLC (after the planning phase) where the project requirements are gathered, studied, and defined in detail. The main goal is to understand what the software must do and how it should behave from both a business and technical perspective.

Importance:

Establishes a clear understanding between stakeholders and the development team.

Reduces the risk of errors, misunderstandings, and scope creep.

Forms the foundation for design, development, testing, and maintenance.

Helps in identifying potential challenges and limitations early in the project.

2. Sub-steps of the Analysis Phase

The analysis phase typically involves several critical sub-steps:

a) Requirements Gathering

Collect all functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders, end-users, and business analysts.

Methods: interviews, questionnaires, observation, workshops, and document analysis.

Output: preliminary list of system requirements.

b) Requirements Analysis

Examine and prioritize gathered requirements for feasibility, clarity, and relevance.

Identify conflicts or redundancies.

Use techniques like use cases, user stories, and workflow diagrams to visualize requirements.

c) Feasibility Study

Assess technical, operational, and financial feasibility.

Determine if the project can be delivered within the constraints (budget, time, technology).

Helps in decision-making whether to proceed, adjust, or terminate the project.

d) Requirements Specification

Formalize the analyzed requirements in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

SRS includes: functional requirements, performance requirements, user interface requirements, and constraints.

Acts as a reference for developers and testers.

e) Requirement Validation

Ensure all requirements are correct, complete, and agreed upon by stakeholders.

Conduct reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping to confirm understanding.

3. Deliverables and Outcomes

The main deliverables of the analysis phase include:

Requirements Document (SRS): Detailed documentation of all system requirements.

Feasibility Report: Assessment of technical, operational, and financial feasibility.

Use Case Diagrams / User Stories: Visual representation of user interactions.

Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM): Maps each requirement to its corresponding design and testing component.

Outcomes:

Clear, unambiguous requirements that guide design and development.

Identification of potential risks or obstacles early on.

A baseline for project scope and estimates.

4. Best Practices

Engage all relevant stakeholders continuously.

Use clear, unambiguous, and measurable requirements.

Prioritize requirements based on business value and urgency.

Use visual aids like flowcharts, mockups, and diagrams to improve understanding.

Maintain a flexible approach to accommodate changes without scope creep.

5. Common Challenges

Miscommunication between stakeholders and development team.

Changing or unclear requirements.

Overlooking non-functional requirements like performance, security, and usability.

Scope creep due to late additions or changing business needs.

Insufficient time or resources for thorough analysis.

1. What is a Product Backlog and Its Purpose

A Product Backlog is a prioritized list of work items, features, enhancements, bug fixes, and technical tasks that a development team maintains for a product. It represents everything that could be done to improve or complete the product.

Purpose:

Serves as the single source of truth for all planned work.

Helps the product owner and development team plan, prioritize, and track progress.

Ensures the team focuses on delivering maximum value to the user.

Provides flexibility to adapt to changing requirements or business priorities.

2. How to Create and Structure a Product Backlog
Creating a Product Backlog:

Collect Requirements:

Gather input from stakeholders, users, and business analysts.

Include functional requirements (features) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability).

Break Down Requirements:

Divide larger features into smaller, manageable units called user stories or tasks.

Each item should ideally be small enough to complete in a sprint.

Define Acceptance Criteria:

Specify conditions that must be met for each backlog item to be considered “done.”

Estimate Effort:

Assign rough estimates (story points, hours, or complexity) to help in planning.

Structuring a Product Backlog:

Items are typically ordered by priority, from most important to least.

Backlog items often include:

User stories: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]."

Bugs or defects

Technical tasks or improvements

Common hierarchy:

Epics: Large features or themes.

User Stories: Specific functionalities derived from epics.

Tasks: Subdivided items required to complete a story.

3. Backlog Prioritization Techniques

Prioritization ensures the team works on items that deliver the most value first. Common techniques include:

MoSCoW Method:

Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have.

Value vs. Effort / Cost-Benefit Analysis:

Prioritize high-value, low-effort items first.

Kano Model:

Categorizes features into basic needs, performance features, and delighters.

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF):

Prioritize items that maximize business value relative to effort or risk.

Stakeholder Voting / Business Priority:

Engage stakeholders to rank items based on strategic importance.

4. Backlog Refinement and Maintenance

Backlog Refinement (or Grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing and updating the backlog to keep it current, relevant, and actionable.

Activities in Backlog Refinement:

Break down large items into smaller tasks.

Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria.

Reassess priority based on changing business needs.

Remove outdated or low-value items.

Update estimates and dependencies.

Maintenance Tips:

Conduct regular refinement sessions (often mid-sprint or weekly).

Ensure the backlog always has enough well-defined items for the next sprint.

Keep stakeholders involved to maintain alignment with business goals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Definition of User Stories

A User Story is a short, simple description of a software feature from the end-user’s perspective. It captures what the user wants to do, why they want it, and helps guide the development team to build features that deliver real value.

Purpose:

Focuses on user needs rather than technical specifications.

Encourages collaboration between stakeholders, product owners, and developers.

Supports iterative development in Agile frameworks like Scrum.

2. User Story Format

The most common format for writing a user story is:

“As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason/benefit].”

Example:

As a registered user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.

Components Explained:

Role (As a…): Identifies who will benefit from this feature (user, admin, guest, etc.).

Goal (I want…): Describes the specific action or functionality the user needs.

Benefit (So that…): Explains why the user wants it or the value it provides.

3. How to Write Effective User Stories

Effective user stories are clear, concise, and actionable. Best practices include:

INVEST Principle:

Independent: Can be developed separately.

Negotiable: Open for discussion, not rigid.

Valuable: Delivers value to the user or business.

Estimable: Can be reasonably sized or estimated.

Small: Can be completed in a sprint.

Testable: Has clear acceptance criteria to validate completion.

Keep Stories Simple and Focused:

Avoid complex or vague descriptions.

Each story should cover one feature or action.

Collaborate:

Engage stakeholders, product owners, and developers when writing stories to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Include Context and Examples:

Add details or mockups if needed to avoid ambiguity.

4. Acceptance Criteria and Their Importance

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are conditions that a user story must meet to be considered complete. They provide a clear definition of “done” and guide testing.

Importance:

Ensures that the delivered feature meets the user’s expectations.

Reduces misunderstandings between the development team and stakeholders.

Helps QA and developers know what to test and verify.

Enables clear validation and prevents scope creep.

Example of Acceptance Criteria for the password reset story:

User can request a password reset via email.

User receives a password reset link within 5 minutes.

Link expires after 24 hours.

User can successfully set a new password and log in.
